      <h1 class="png-text">Papua New Guinea</h1>
      <h2 align="center"><font size="19" color="yellow">50 Years of Indepenedence</font></h2>

      <p>
        Papua New Guinea’s 50 Years Anniversary is not just for celebration. For me, it’s a time to stop and think about how far our country has come since independence. We have done some good things, but we still face many problems. This anniversary makes me think about what the country has achieved, how our people have changed, and what kind of citizens we have become. It’s also the right time to talk about corruption, which is one of the biggest problems in Papua New Guinea.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 1975, Papua New Guinea has developed in some areas — we now have more schools, hospitals, and roads in towns. But in many villages, people still struggle. Some places don’t have proper clinics, teachers, or good roads. Money is often sent for these projects, but people don’t see any real work done. The country’s Independent Commission Against Corruption said that PNG may be losing up to four billion kina every year through corruption and misuse of public funds (ICAC PNG, 2024). When this happens, the ordinary people suffer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many citizens try their best to live right and work hard, but some leaders don’t do the same. We hear stories in the news about money going missing or being spent on things that don’t help the people. A report by The Guardian said a whistle-blower claimed that Australian aid money meant for refugee welfare in PNG “went missing” and investigations were stopped (Doherty, 2023). That shows how deep the problem is — when people in power don’t care, the ones who need help end up with nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        To me, corruption in Papua New Guinea means when government money that should help everyone gets stolen, wasted, or used only by a few people. It’s when schools don’t have books or hospitals don’t have medicine because someone took the money. During the APEC summit, a letter to the Prime Minister said over a million dollars went missing and many payments were not approved (Whiting, 2019). This is why many people call PNG a corrupt country — not because we want to, but because we see never see any developement.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the next 50 years, we need to change that. Leaders should be honest, and people should be able to see how government money is used. Reports and budgets should be public so everyone can check. Leaders must set a good example so citizens can trust them again. Also, the young generation needs to speak up and make sure things are done properly. Only then will Papua New Guinea move forward the right way.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, PNG’s 50 Years Anniversary is a time for reflection. We should celebrate our culture and freedom, but we must also face the truth. Corruption has stopped our country from growing the way it should. If we fix that, the next 50 years will be much better for our children and grandchildren.
